I decided to build a web app to help them do just that.\n\nIt's publicly available at [ConectRE.com](https://conectre.com){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n## Key Features\n\n![View of contacts to track information, past conversations, and set reminders.](assets/1_conect_re/contact.png){.bordered}\n\n![Homepage to easily track all contacts and reminders.](assets/1_conect_re/home.png){.bordered}\n\n![Auth powered by Supabase AuthUI with sign in with Google enabled.](assets/1_conect_re/signin.png){.bordered}\n\n## Tech and Stack\n\nThis project was built over two weekends. It uses a NextJS frontend with Supabase as the backend. The frontend is deployed on Vercel. Styling is done with TailwindCSS.\n\n<style>\n    img.bordered {\n        border: 2px solid black;\n    }\n</style>\n\n",
