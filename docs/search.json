    "text": "A conversation with personal fitness trainer Mohammed “Mo” Ahmed (@mobamba_fitness on Instagram) inspired our latest product, Fitpics.co. Mo has spent years transforming his physique and health and has begun sharing his knowledge through personal training. With his first clients, he shared with us the value of keeping them accountable by having them send progress pictures after each workout. This led our team to the concept of a text based accountability partner and progress tracker."
