## The Story

After connecting with many students at the Rutgers Real Estate Club, I realized that many of them were looking for a way to stay in touch with their contacts. I decided to build a web app to help them do just that.

It's publicly available at [ConectRE.com](https://conectre.com){target="_blank"}.

## Key Features

![Homepage to easily track all contacts and reminders.](assets/1_conect_re/home.png){.bordered}

![Auth powered by Supabase AuthUI with sign in with Google enabled.](assets/1_conect_re/signin.png){.bordered}

## Tech and Stack

This project was built over two weekends. It uses a NextJS frontend with Supabase as the backend. The frontend is deployed on Vercel. Styling is done with TailwindCSS.

<style>
    img.bordered {
        border: 2px solid black;
    }
</style>
