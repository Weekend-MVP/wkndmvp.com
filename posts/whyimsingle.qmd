## The Story

The spectacular launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 appears to be one of the most disruptive technologies of the past decade. Although OpenAI’s large language models seem to have all the answers, it feels like we’ve been left with more questions than ever before. While meaning, purposes, and education are all under question, the team at Weekend MVP's biggest question was how SEO might be disrupted by artificial intelligence. To explore this, we used GPT-4 to generate hundreds of pages and launched [WhyImSingle.lol](https://www.whyimsingle.lol/){target="_blank"}, a leaderboard-style blog site that humorously covers news on high-profile celebrity and socialite divorces.


## Final Product and Features
